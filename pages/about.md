## Abstract

This digital archive presents six documents chronicling U.S. government weather modification experiments, uncovering the controversial and largely hidden history behind them, as revealed through official reports and records. The Dyrenforth Experiments of the 1890s marked the first documented attempt at weather modification in U.S. history. In the decades that followed, the U.S. government expanded its weather modification programs both domestically and internationally, with significant operations in Southeast Asia. During the Vietnam War, there were classified operations demonstrating the military applications of weather modification. The goal was leveraging cloud seeding to create large rainfall events that would develop mudslides and general havoc; thereby reducing North Vietnamese infiltration and disrupting supply lines. 

In unclassified weather modification experiments, from 1962 to 1983 Project Stormfury represented an ambitious attempt to weaken hurricanes through cloud seeding. This document collection offers a glimpse into weather modification activity from various government agencies, including declassified military documents, congressional hearings, and scientific studies. These primary sources continue to raise crucial questions about the ethical implications of weather modification technology, similar to the implications raised by others in previous generations.

## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
