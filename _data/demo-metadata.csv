This hearing explored the idea of an international agreement to ban environmental manipulation as a weapon due to the ecological and ethical dangers associated with such usage. A central concern emerged regarding the Department of Defense's absence of comprehensive guidelines for weather modification in warfare, particularly given the risk of catastrophic environmental consequences. In the end, they reached a conclusion of preventing the environmental and geophysical modification activity in warfare, but did not limit the usage to researches, experimentations and peaceful purposes.",congress weather modification,United States,38.9,-77.04,"Fulbright, J.
